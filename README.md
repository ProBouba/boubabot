Here. Roe V Wade is uh should be good decision legalizing abortion. Last year was the the other
Supreme Court decision making it unconstitutional, making it illegal again. I talked about the one
making segregation constitutional, 1896. A very sad moment in U.S. history. The Supreme Court
decide that it's OK. To segregate people of color in school, in public consultations, in cafeterias. OK,
meaning it's not incompatible with racial equality. Weird, right? It's called the separate but equal
decision. You are separate in space, but you remain equal. Which is such a lie or mistake that the
Supreme Court changes its mind 58 years later. And it's probably most famous decision in the case of
Brown versus Board of Education round the board of Board of Education. Say, in decision by the
Supreme Court in the case of Brown versus Board of Education, 1954, Brown is a black student who
would like to enter a white college. He was refused access, so he takes the case to the Supreme
Court and this time the Supreme Courts decide that we jetting student round is unconstitutional. So
the Supreme Court. Suppresses segregation the back door. Forces this white college to integrate
Brown. He has to enter the school with the National Guard protecting him. Because widespread
racists are ready to lynch him. But you see, in 1954, segregation ends constitutional. So 58 years
distance, two absolutely opposite decisions. OK, same with abortion 19732022 absolutely opposite
decisions. OK, so the Supreme Court takes decisions depending on who are justices. Well, the people
making decisions depending on historical circumstances. How would vanced? OK, mines and mores
and politics are OK, in other words. In other words, it's a very human institution. Making mistakes? I
think we had covered. The executive. Given the executive president is commander in Chief of armed
Forces, OK, Congress makes laws, vetoes, presidents, decisions. OK, we've done all that. So I'll end.
The chapter on politics with. Couple things. First, I'll give you examples of two periods in U.S. history.
When US politics were full of contradictions, we've always been full of contradictions. But let's take
two examples. Two examples. You don't know if they're older. OK. Oh. Where is it? There's one
example in the 1830s. 1830s. Good years ago. Under President Jackson. Not Michael. President
Jackson. Takes an important decision which makes. The US political system more democratic? Until
the 1830s, voting. Was restricted. To owners, people who own something. Proprietors. OK. And
other words, there was a voting restriction based on property. President Jackson suppressed. Which
is a progress, right? At the same time, in France you also have. Voting restrictions based on property
for Francis Abel. Yeah. Vehicle presented that he lets you know. So now. In the US, factory workers,
farmers with no land can vote. But of course, a limit to this great democratic progress is that slavery
is still in place. In other words. Black people can't vote, of course. Women can't vote either. OK, so
it's a democracy, but it's a democracy based on strong racial and sexual hierarchies. Which is the
case everywhere on the planet at that time anyway. OK. So you see progress, but still. Regression. I
guess you should always. Observe or consider U.S. history with these kind of contradictions. Second
example. The 1900s or the third of the 20th century? Good wood. 1900s. The 1900s are called the
Progressive Era, the Progressive Era. Good. In fact, the Progressive Era goes from the 1890s to World
War One. It's called the progressive you're out because it is an era of progress. OK. Progress because
slavery has been abolished. But. Segregation. In place. Progress also because of the industrial boom,
industrial revolution. Which requires a strong labor force. Right forces the US to improve their laws,
their labour law. Until the 1900s. Children could work in factories at any age. Inlines. People had no
day off, no day off whatsoever. Seven days a week of work. Salaries were not enough to eat, and so
on and so forth. So there are struggles, social struggles to defend labor rights, and finally labor rights
are adopted. But there is a lot of poverty. Extreme poverty in the US at that time. Mostly
immigrants. Immigrants coming from Europe or Asia and living in in very poor conditions. But there
are conditions are improved. By the help of charities. Charities. What's called charities in English is
charity organizations, nonprofit organizations from the justice system. No profit organizations raising
funds. With. Richard, Astrologists with millionaires OK to redistribute the funds to the poor to
minority. But you have to agree that charities are not. The best solution to poverty? That's why you
couldn't somebody out possible once you get this. So. So charities do the job, and plus these women,
they're mostly women, OK? Wives of very rich men. Taking care of these charities, they impose
moral values on the poor people they help. They require them to get married. Dress. You know in
ways correct clothes. To stop drinking alcohol. To believe alcohol is bad. In fact, they're going to
lobby Congress. And they will win. With the lobbying of these rich women from charities Congress.
Will prohibit alcohol. At the end of the 1900s, the era of prohibition starts. The sale of alcohol on US
territory is prohibited. Until the late 1930s. Busy. What I'm saying here is. Every era has its aspect of
progress. Social progress, moral progress, political progress. But they are also regressions, or at least
strong limitations. Justice and quality. Sorry. Oh, so progressive. Ready. Let's end with a bit of block
computer. Very important so you understand US politics. Um, which are the two peoples parties?
Yeah, Democratic Party, Democratic Democratic Party, and the Republican Party. Of. The Democratic
Party. It's very centrist. Not really left with right. It's not left and right. Very centrist. And the
Republican Party is more conservative. By the way, the Republican Party very often is called the
GOP. The open GOP. Which stands for Grand old party, Grand old party, but it's the old. You. So
what you have to understand is that the real political division. Spectrum in the US is not really
between left and right. It's more exactly between. Uh, well, where is it? Here it is liberals and
conservatives. Liberals. And conservatives? The Democratic Party is more liberal. The Republican
Party is more conservative. So let's explain these two words. Liberal. Doesn't have the same meaning
as in French. In French, if you say liberal, usually you refer to economically people liberal, you know,
pro free market, pro capitalist. In English, it's very different. In English, liberal means politically
liberal. Sometimes it means um. Center left. It's also good because politically liberal means.
Defending civil liberties, defending civil liberties, liberal liberties? What are civil liberties? Civil
liberties are, well, the liberties that are in the Constitution already, like freedom of expression. Of
speech, of the press, freedom of religion, which is also the freedom not to believe in God. Very
important. Liberals defend the freedom not to believe in God because religion is so important in the
US, sometimes we forget this freedom. Do not believe in God and they defend, liberals defend. The
diversity of opinions. OK. And also. Progress as in the change. Of values. Liberals typically defended
the sexual revolution in the 1960s and 70s, defended contraceptives, abortion, OK, usually they are
opposed to the death penalty. Because they believe civil liberties are in danger if the state. Acts like
a murderer. And one important moment when liberals mobilize in the US is at the end of the 19th
century. At the time. Of Darwin. You've all heard about Darwin, right? Charles Darwin, the British
scientist. The man who demonstrated the theory of evolution. Evolution from Admirals to mankind.
This theory of evolution once demonstrated. Was in contradiction with the religious theory that the
world was created. Alright. So the works of Darwin, which were distributed in the US, it was in
English, were banned. We're prohibited. And when they were allowed, people would gather on the
main square of a city and burn hundreds of copies of the glass. Giant fire. Put them where your
nose., below I mean. Right, so. Defenders of civil liberties reacted to that. The struggle they took
lawyers, OK, who took the case to the Supreme Court, to the federal administration, and finally got
the police and the National Guard to impose the freedom to publish and distribute these books.
Because they believe everyone has a right to their instruction to know. Still have my opinion, yes. His
work going work well, then he got read by everyone, but in initially it could not be right. It was not
accessible in the US it's probably. So you see, defending the ideas of Darwin, defending the freedom
of women, defending sexual freedom. Defending the pause, this is liberal. But both and to
conservatives were conservatives. Conservatives are those who want to conserve, to preserve. The
traditional way of life, the US traditions. Such as family values. Religious values. Factorio autism, but
stronger patriotism than liberals. OK. And sometimes, always some sort of racial favor. Racial
hierarchy? What you have to understand is that. It's it's it looks like it's left and right kind of thing,
right? But in reality, both are quite moderate. It's more like center left and center right. Quite
moderate. They're moderate seekers. They do not want to change the US system. OK, moderate
conservatives. Just want to win elections. They don't want to invade the capital building like. Those
crazy Trump supporters did. A year ago. And liberals of the Democratic Party. Well, to improve the
US, but they do not want to overthrow capitalism. Not all. They're fine with capitalism. It works
pretty well. Understand, they're moderate, which means that the US political system is, or was it is
changing. A system of consensus. A system where political opinions are not so far from each other.
But there is an exception. There are people at both extremes, far left, far right, who are not
moderate. Who do not want to keep the same political system. OK. Who want to change it?
Overthrow it brutally. They're called in English. We call them radicals. The word radical means
precisely. People who are not represented in elections and in existing parties, who have stronger
opinions than that OK, and who want to overthrow the whole system, these people. Until recently,
used to be mostly on the left. Like revolutionary Marxists, anarchists, you know, or pulks, OK, or you
know, whatever, free minded people. Today, these people, those radical harmoniously on the far
right, because the far left is not very visible in the US, is it? They're mostly on the far right. They are
precisely those. White supremacists and fascists supporting Trump. OK, the ones you saw on these
images invading Congress. OK, January 6, 2021. But be careful. Be subtle. They don't represent the
Republican Party. The Republican Party is more moderate than that. In fact, the Republican Party is
divided between a majority who says they have nothing to do with us and the minority who say we
might need them. OK, because the public opinion in the US likes them more and more, we might
need them. So, but officially, the Republican Party doesn't want to overthrow anything. It's not
fascist, it's not white supremacist, and recognizes that Donald Trump has lost the 2020 elections. OK.
So what I mean is that both parties and both those ideologies are moderate. Which, not moderate, is
radical opinions, and radical opinions today are mostly on the far right and on the far right. What
they want to do is. Well, you don't really know there. Brain damaged, but they want to return to
racial and sexual hierarchies of yesteryear. Years to years, yesterday we did. Yesterday here. Hello.
Come here. Come in. The neurophone. Yes, Sir. Yeah. They want to defend the US at all cost against
immigrants, legal or illegal. But legal and only to defend themselves legal means they are American,
right? Against foreign threats. Read it crazy. They believe that the US is going to be invaded by
United Nations soldiers of color. And as you know, because of social media conspiracy theories, OK,
and Idiocracy. Idiocracy means the reign of stupidity. Which is the side the world is needs to live.
They believe that the Democratic Party does not exist. It's just to cover. For the network of
pedophiles, Satanists. Rage. It's. Right. Well. According to polls and studies, 15 percent, 15%, and
that's a conservative estimate, will be conservative estimates. 15% of Americans believe that. In
France, we're not doing much better. OK. In France, I think it's between 25 and 30% of people
believe that the State of Israel. Controls the world economy. But we. Let's see what I mean. There's
there's that stupid that they haven't seen, but the state of Israel was rich and powerful. There was a
small country. And I think the the proportion of people who believe the earth is flat. Is about the
same in both countries, but it's still close to 10%, close to 10% you go out in the street, 1% of the 10
believe it's flat. Come on, look at that, it's flat, right? That's another story what we're interested in
here. You like traffic. Geometry exists of OK, so liberal versus conservative and radical versus
moderate. But at the same time, we can criticize the US political system by partisanship.
Bipartisanship has reached its limits. Today, both of these parties don't really represent the US
population. There are people on the left. Including young people who don't think that Joe Biden or
Hillary Clinton are on the left and you don't recognize themselves. Very official people and there are
people on the far right who want to go much. Stronger and much more on the right than with the
Republican Party. OK, so bipartisanship has reached its limits. That's that's the political crisis you
have in the US today. And one last word, it's about. Voting sociology. But that, I suppose you know.
The country is the country today is strongly divided between liberals. Middle class, living in large
cities, interested in protecting the environment, eating better, traveling abroad. OK, they mostly live
in the two most populated portions of the US, which is. California. The coast of California. And the
northeast coast? New York, Boston. Most people. Division between these and. Leave the Super
conservative right of the Republican Party. Somehow supremacist of fascists. Depending on what
kind of idea you offer them, who lives mostly in between. In between, in this gigantic country.
Scarcely populated, that's like all these operated, but. If you look at a voting map, it is so interesting.
Check your voting map on Google for the for the for any election. Usually they use blue ball
democratic and red for Republican. Which for us is weird because we associate red with the left,
right for instance, you know right is Republican, so you. We'll see a map with two dense blue zones
on both coasts and a gigantic red territory in the middle. And this is the division of today's America.
These are two different countries, different ideologies, different lifestyles, different visions of the
world and of course, different votes. So we move to the next chapter. And the next chapter is. Is.
The majority of minorities. Majority of minority. So, so far we've seen. The political system now will
see who are Americans. First of all, it's an extremely diverse population. More diverse than
anywhere else. Let's start with this. With these categories, I would say there are four kinds of people
in the US. First, you have the people who were there. Before Europeans. Game America. Native
America. Whatever it is on you. Native Americans. Very few are left today. 2 to 3,000,000. Less than
1%? Your percent of the US population, Native Americans. Second category is. The descendants of
the millions of Africans. Brought by force to America to become slaves. OK, they called African
Americans. And they form 13 percent, 13% of the US population. Third. The white population. But
you don't say white. Remember, skin color don't exist anymore. You know, they're not an eagle term
black, you'll say white, at least politically correct language. You know why they're called. How are
they called? Yeah, they called Caucasians, Caucasians, Caucasians. OK. Yeah, you see. The reason is
that. So all of that is due to. Increase by the. US Census you don't see anything in US Census Bureau.
Zero to 4. Questions. Why caucasians? Because you don't. Qualified. A group of people by their skin
color. Not by their race, because race is the only. You qualify them by the place, the geographical
place, where the oldest Member of this group was found. So. Blacks or African Americans, who
obviously the most ancient trace of black people in Africa. And why that Caucasians? Because, yes,
archaeologists and prehistorians. How far is the oldest trace of a white settlement in the Caucasian
region? OK, look, you said. In the region, clear whether limit or follow up. Don't put me on the line.
But. Approval below source. Caucasians. Caucasian. We saw the two members in used to the.
Caucasians are still the statistic majority in the US. But be careful, not for long, not for long, yes. I'm
sorry. William. Yes. Of course. Absolutely. And and you're right I should be, I should be clear. I should
add immediately my 4th category, my 4th category, remember I said there are four. Fourth category
is the rest and the rest is. All full of color, all non white or all non Caucasians. Apart from African
Americans. OK. Which means mostly, mostly. Immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Central
and South America and from the entire Asian continent. OK. Near East, Middle East, South Asia, Far
East Asia. You. Today, Asian Americans, which doesn't include. Middle East, South Asia, Far East Asia.
Asian Americans are about 14%, slightly more than African Americans. So if yeah, if you add
immigrants from Central and South America, sometimes called Latinos or Chicanos, and immigrants
and descendants of immigrants from Asia. That's a huge group. And what's interesting is that. If you
add up these people. Latin America African Americans are Native Americans altogether. You could
say they're all people of color. Today, they are approximately 45% of the US population. In other
words, white people, Caucasians are 55%. Within 15 to 20 years. This proportion will reverse. In
other words, before 2050, this is certain. Demographers are clear about that. It's certainly before
2050. Caucasians will be a minority. The majority of the US population will be made of minorities.
This chapter and majority of minorities. US, most of them are mixed. And so if you get into the
details, how do you define an African American as opposed to a mixed person? It's very arguable. It
depends on. For example, you have you need to have three grandparents out of four minimum of
three, OK, of African American descent, but themselves are already mixed. How do you do? Say, for
Latinos and so on. But you know, you don't have limits. What's important is to remember that the
white Caucasian majority, which is not only a statistical majority, but a political and historical
majority. Are people lining are going to be mine? And I suppose this is good news, because the
multicultural model of the US will be finally a reality. Alright. OK. The US is a country. In fact, the
proportion of. Descendants of immigrants in the US population. It's very simple 99.5%. 99.5% of
Americans are descendants of immigrants because only 0.5% are natives. OK. Anybody has a clue?
you do of this proportion in france what's the proportion of which second and third generation
people who were born was was much lower, much smaller. OK, before the 20th century existed at
all, in the 20th century, it started with Italians, OK, and then Spaniards and Portuguese. But it's a
recent phenomenon, so the estimate. He estimates a very rough estimate is that it's probably 35 to
40%. Of the French population descent. You see the difference? These are not the same countries,
the countries, France, where the statistical majority is made of people who, as far as they can see in
their genealogy, they've been, they've always been here. Unfortunately. In the US, this doesn't make
sense. In the US, everybody except those portages. Part of immigrant descent. It is of immigration,
right? And I will start with the immigrations started. 20,000 years ago. Yes. What, because those
people with bold nature investing? You know what you know. We used to call them Indians. You find
them in Salzkammergut in Central America. You find them everywhere. Minions. Because. We
recognized Asian looking features in their faces. Which is not an illusion. They do come from Asia,
but during the Ice Age. As the glass and all this ended. Hardwood is that money. Page. Most people,
most humans on the planet lived in Asia, essentially, but the Ice Age made their life impossible. They
couldn't grow anything. We should travel anymore. They couldn't live there. Move to table, don't
remove outside of Asia and. You know, I mean. What is this? This is. The eastern part of Siberia. This
is the western tip of Alaska. How's it going this week? Yes, the straits of bearing bearing straight to
bearing, well, Ice Age. The Strait of Bearing with ICE. But these people crushed. OK, they didn't cross
overnight. It took them centuries across. OK, but they crossed and they found more hospitable and
warmer. Climate conditions and the American continents of this gathered. In fact, everywhere
North, Central and South America, they thought you needed this. You know, desert of America. So in
a way, they are the first migrants. All right. By the way. American continent. Continue American.
Yeah, maybe the people. Hello. Of the Western Hemisphere. The Western Hemisphere, I'm gonna
tell him to show and then he's faster than you in total here. Sure, it's apparently bounded. Delete
the Western Hemisphere. Images. That's the what? With the book, if you look at the world from
Asia, then it's eastern English. But, you know, in Eurocentric terms it's called the Western. Western.
Just. Alright, so very first waves of migration in the eyes, then second step, second step. 11th
century. Well, it's over there. You're welcome. No. Um. In 1020. 11th century. Traces have been
found on the East Coast of the US OK Oh, the settlement. Settlements occupied by Scandinavian
people, people from Scandinavia. OK. The beginning like it. Abiding settlement. And the name of
column Stephanie settlement. Question is, why could people from Scandinavia cross the Atlantic?
And find America when the rest of Europe should not. Because someone could row. Is doing much
better on this. What's interesting is that they. Started this settlement. A few settlements, probably,
but another state. They're not conquerors and not, you know, colonizers. They went back home. Got
a good Chinese? You know, it was, it was discovered that the Chinese had landed in Africa 500 years
before Europeans on the eastern coast of Africa. OK, they didn't stay. No conquest, no. Any state. It's
not like today. Today, yeah. Absorbing and stealing most of African lands, OK, but at that time they
didn't stay. Like Vikings and in North America. In other words. 500 years later. When the King of
Spain OK and rich Italian merchants. Organize the powerful expedition to go West. An expedition led
by this Portuguese sailor, famous sailor named as named Christopher Columbus. This expedition did
not discover America very I've been discovered already, and that there's nothing to discover if there
were already people there. And plus. The Columbus Expedition of 1492. Did not. Arrive on the
continent. OK, they landed in the Bahamas. The islands of the Bahamas off the coast of Florida. OK.
And it didn't state. Alright. And this is the time, you know, the middle of the second Millennium, the
15 sixteen, 17th century. This is the time when Europeans start conquering the world, colonizing the
world. Navigating on all the seas and the oceans of the world. OK, OK, so navigators from many
European countries are interested in going to America. You know that the delete it was Asia. When
they arrived there, they called it new India. They thought it was in. They didn't really recognize India,
called the new India. Double secret? Feel like West Indies? Is on the list. What's the border of
people? Indeed. So they traveled West, thinking they were traveling east, but whatever. And so
many of them arrived everywhere, right? You had Portuguese conquering South America? Spaniards
conquering um. Central and part of North America, British including pirates. Conquering portions of
North America. Also that also sorts of people. So maybe I'll give you a few names. Are you ready?
You know, write names of these famous navigators. Well, the most important for us that we'll go
back to him is this British guy, Walter Raleigh, and he's Walter Raleigh. Walter Rodney, because
Walter Raleigh is the first navigator who landed a settled settled, not landed, settled in North
America. OK. In the place which is today the capital city of Virginia called Raleigh. You have Walter,
really. But you also have Italian navigators such as Verrazano, Giovanni Verrazano, Verrazano. What
did he discover? Word OK. This is the East Coast of the US you recognize Florida? You discovered this
place. Today, it's the Bay of New York. Right. And the fact that they of New York today, it's closed by
this huge bridge, the largest bridge in the US called the Pirates. Another important Italian navigator,
yes. Absolutely. Very good. Amerigo vespucci. Vespucci left his first name. Which became the name
of the new continent Amerigo. Special. And all. Amerigo vespucci. About this, right? Then you also
have. John Cabot, the British navigator. Cabots. You not be able to cabots. Even have a French
navigator. Who's the big French navigator conqueror of North America at that time. Zach Carter. Like
the guy who discovered the estuary, there's a giant estuary north of the US here. The estuary of the
River Solo hall and this estuary is where Quebec and Montreal are today. Founded, you know, a
village there and called displaced. New friends, new friends. You even have a Dutch navigator. This
guy Henry Hudson, Dutch. Longer. Henry Hudson Henry Hudson after Verrazzano discovered today
he's the first one who. Started the village. And of course, he called this village Amsterdam. And new
Amsterdam. Later became New York. Actually left his name on the big rig and ending in New York,
the Hudson. And so on and so forth and. The crazy thing is that Europeans were so interested in this
new continent, this new horizon, that the Pope. The Catholic book. Decided to distribute. The new
continent to Europeans, he decided that. All of north. America. Would be for Spaniards. And all of
South America would be for Portuguese. Yes, exactly. That's exactly what the King of England
thought, he said. Who's this guy? Does he think that the world belongs to? Why is he dividing the
continent just between Spaniards and Portuguese? What about us? So they refused painful decision.
OK. And they, those British, they organized more, more expedition to North America to prove that
they were there? This is exactly when Walter Raleigh. In 1587 organize his expedition and. Found the
first settlement, the first European settlement on today's US territory in Raleigh. But there is a very
interesting story. This settlement. Started rally. Travel back to England and he came back with a new
shipment woman the moment weapons four years later. Nobody was there. They had vanished.
Disappeared. There were a few forces, much less than the number of people initially. OK, there were
signs of destruction. It was a mysterious word carved with a knife on the tree. Baskets grow out on
right this one. Through attorney did not or whatever Croatoan which no one ever understood, but
it's me pro atone. What's used? It seemed really good, this inaugural story. OK, first failed
settlement in the US seems like it was written by a Hollywood scriptwriter. It sounds like a
blockbuster, right? Perfect story. Well. The US Colonial America started with a mystery. So Raleigh
decided to send more expeditions. OK, the British crown sent more votes and more navigators and
started settling on the East Coast. Today's United States. But who's that? This is where it gets report.
Who settled the people most interested? And going there and leaving Great Britain. Were a religious
minority in England. England had gone through the Reformation, the Reformation said. You'll have.
Pledge of the Reformation right in the 16th century you have two monks. In Germany and
Switzerland, one by the name of Luther, the name of by the name of Calvin who? Decided to break
with the Catholic Church. Because it depended on the new interpretation of the Bible. They
defended a new release. Different lifestyle. So they wrote the species. The road and of course, and
entered into a long year round of religious wars. And each country where each country where
Protestants won but developed their own branch of Protestantism. In England it was called the
Anglican Religion Anglican. Yeah. And there were Christian people in England who. Did not agree
with the Anglican church. We had their own way of practicing the protest and religion. They would
call themselves. They would call themselves Baptists. Sometimes, sometimes it's called themselves
because they had a more rigorous, a more austere. And dictation of the Bible. OK, what's up? But
there were a minority didn't agree with the main Church of England. Not good for them in the 16th
century. So decided. To go to a place where no one would prevent them from. Practicing their
religion. They decided to leave with those. And this settled. In America, colonial America. Sometimes
also because of these problems travels, they would call themselves pilgrims, the pilgrims. Pilgrims.
So there's the Puritans and issues in America. They developed a very strict lifestyle, very strict, very
religious, very hard working with a hard life. Tough weather. Extreme weather. War with Native
Americans. Animals. Continents. And it was so religious that they forced everyone in the community
to. Obey their rules and those who would not obey their rules. Would be cold. Which is. So she. And
what did they do with witches? They would sentence them to death and or even the library. But be
careful, witches are not, because we don't think that witches are like crazy. This is in the world.
Which is where people people, people who did not comply with the strict rules. So men, men and
women who stayed single. To marry you. Vanguard. Mechanoid. So marrying. Refusing to work the
land or to work like other people did work OK refusing to go to church. So these people got, oh,
refreshed and a deal until until very last tribal. Yeah, no, see you. The very last trial, the Winston
Witches, is in 1692 in the city of Salem. Solemn I couldn't. It's the last time in American history when
a group of people are sentenced to death and burned alive, which being which seemed witchcraft,
witchcraft after that. They are sent to jail but no longer killed 69. Also, we be careful, not all
Americans, all colonial Americans are like that. the largest group is the middle of pilgrims, but you
also have other groups. OK, so the whole yeah, you Catholics. Now the small minority of Catholics.
OK, Catholics coming from southern Europe or France or small portions of England. Catholics, they
settle. Is that all? Over here. In New York and Virginia, in this province that they called Maryland,
Maryland the land of Mary. That $70. Add Washington young Catholics, you have non tomatoes. Yes,
they're even our non believers people who. Mr. butcher. All those signs themselves collectively.
Sometimes they criticize slavery. Imagine slavery has hardly started, and you already have. OK, these
people, some of these people decided to create a community off the coast of Boston. Rhode Island,
Rhode Island. So you have all sorts of people. You don't only have crazy Puritans living a tough life.
Underline witches OK and having saves, you have all. And by the way. Because I speak about it, one
important date and very early colonial America is 16191619 because according to historian. That
year. You have a Spanish vote arriving in Virginia. Bringing. 100 men, men, men stolen in Western
Africa. And selling them. To local farmers, British farmers, in other words, it's the beginning of the
slave trade. 1619 grade leave trade starts in 1619. Efficient, according to his daughters. The puppet.
Love cell. Doesn't change much in any case. 2 1/2. Who were you here? Sorry. Depending on Britain.
Life where various communities trying to speak this very religious. And also because I mostly
mentioned rally, but you have two directions for. Immigration from Britain. Something some settle.
We should also New York, which more OK verification. North Carolina, the largest group, will settle
what's called New England. OK. The northeast end? Right. Later, but more of them. And especially
the very first expedition. Arrive in Plymouth, Plymouth. It was 1607. 1607 in Plymouth, and this is
where you have the very famous bold the Mayflower. You've heard about the Mayflower, right?
Because life, Americans. All want to pretend the their, you know, ancestors were on the Mayflower.
Prove the Mayflower is part of the first very dangerous expedition in England, so they start the
village of Plymouth. Yeah, insert start big city here in the city of Boston under the 16301630. So little
by little, you people more, more activity, more Puritans in the Northeast than in the original section
of Virginia and North Carolina. Even though climate is is harder stuff and more. All right. Where do
oh. we go now from there? It's all ready now to debunk. The message about America? Hold it up. We
stop for Lumbus did not for America. America is the country of immigration. But part of that
immigration is. Every the largest part is freewheeling, freewheeling. When they messed, noxious
were all good. That's where you want me? Pretty willing. Also the fact that Americans were there
largely, largely. And the and themselves, they came from migration and migration of the ice. And
keep in mind that diversity of opinions of reddits, practice of lifestyles even in colonial America. Yes,
speaking. I mean in the United States there are also. Yes, yes, the starvation in Ireland. Oh. Actually,
this is where we're going now. Now we've got cover the big waves of immigration and the Irish
immigration. We have to leave Island. Island was 15 of. A disease that killed the crops. OK. Which
resulted into the largest foundation you know in the United Kingdom ever, killing half of the Irish
population. The rest of them. To America. You said you have Irish. The wire. Also, while I'm at it,
when you say Africa, you say African Americans. Reached Americans. So you know you. There's two.
Hypnotized America. Yeah, well, that's his. The result is all real. One guy. If you put. Ordinary. Hobby
building. I want to- Williams. Who's? America. Proximately. The discovery of Australia. Here again,
no discovery of the original original people. Dinner and child. Oh. 17th and 18th century, actually,
actually, it's not. The most dangerous English. They put the. We have. Of the British prison. Locals in
London. Yeah. The media is organized. Love this up. Why does this appear all the way? Healthy
woman. Jim. Well, where you were. Offensive. Go through some results. In 1750, before
independence, you have 1,000,000 people. Hardly anybody. Be careful. Until the 19th century
African slave family back. OK, so it's gonna be another. Another move. 18105 million. 1850 you have
the 1st jump. Because you very beginning of European immigration. From outside of England and
the rest of Europe. And the and better conditions of living people survive later longer 181523 million
then look at that. In 50 years population is multiplied by three. Because in the second-half, right, the
19th century is where huge, huge immigration from Europe and Asia into America. OK. Then 1900 to
1950 double. 1950 to 2000 double again. Again. Every 50 years is skin. And this is also because in this
second-half of the 20th century, there's a second major wave of immigration. But this time? Mostly
from Latin America and Asia. No longer from Europe. Today, the estimate of the Sciences Bureau is
between 310 and 320 million Americans. Which sets are inclusion illegal aliens? But. And the
estimate for 25th babies Earth rates is 420 million. OK, so if. Occasion. Copulation can grow that fast.
It's not because of their birth rates. It's immigration. There's no other immigration can increase that
fast the population. So remember these two ways. OK. The two major waves of immigration are in
the end of the 19th century second-half. After the civil war, between the Civil War and World War
One, OK, This is when people come from Ireland. From Central and Eastern Europe, Russians, Poles,
Germans. From southern Europe. Italians, Greeks, OK, but also from East Asia. The first Chinese
immigration was still on the West Coast, the West Coast, obviously it's closer for that. So this is the
first major wave. And this migrant, these immigrants get the worst jobs, OK, but they are. Attracted
by the industrial boom, the US is booming, U.S. economy is rising very fast. So they find jobs, but
they live in they four conditions. They work in very dangerous conditions. And there's so many of
them. That is, strong anti immigrant sentiment grows in the US. OK, the oldest immigrants, the
candidates of Puritans. Still green British and all that. Who called themselves and what? Themselves.
Well then, Monica. White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. OK. Some of them, not all of them, but some of
them grow opposed. To immigration judge. Dictation is. It's like entity entity. Just. remove one. Late
night is the moment when this big debate starts in the US. Should Americans assimilate? Oh. I just
live side by side there. Could you recognize here? Recognize the two muddles, 2 opposed muddles
the assimilation. Which is kind of the French model. And you oppose model of MULTIPLISM, which is
it's OK, you keep your language, your lifestyle, you live together in communities, OK? And these
communities will be juxtaposed, will coexist in peace. There's a very strong it's also the time when.
Writer. Jewish writer. I invest this term, the melting pot. What does he mean by melting pot? It's
exact melting pots and remote. Using melting pot if you have cooked. Melting pot. Where is it like?
What's up? Hi, Daniel. Because I've already. And just. Isn't it? Of modern immigration into the US.
Stops with World War One. Knowledge of the war stopped. And because after the war, after the US
wins World War One. Congress, and in fact of opinion in the US, chooses to suspend or strictly
limited immigration. 1921. 1921. Congress votes the quota law quota Law 1921, the quota law. Gives
a specific number of authorized immigrants from each. Every year we accept that many Asians, that,
many French that, many Russians that. Hardly any immigration discussed it will discuss it. There is a.
Same with word. Would you save after? Well, this this year of isolation from immigration stops. In
1962 or 63 and there are two large. These years. The ban on immigration from the rest of America is
is good. She's this Christ. No more limit on immigration from Asia. So people from India, from the
Middle East, from the Indochinese peninsula, or from China rush into the US, OK, which explains the
second-half of any second wave. Sorry, of immigration. OK. No longer from Europe, hardly from
Europe, mostly from South America and Asia. These are the two ways and of course today. sing the
conservative people. You want to suspend immigration and go back to 1921 limit strictly limit
immigration. we'll stop here next week we will see the biggest portion of
